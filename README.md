# D3-Challenge

REQUIRED - This challenge was about building a scatter graph using D3 using data relating to health care risks factors that were provided in a .csv file.  At minimum, the challenge was to import the data, create an svg area, a scatter plot in that area with appropriate axes, scaling, and axes labels.  Also, each data circle was to display the state the data represents as well as tool tip information.   All of this was accomplished.  

BONUS - As an additional challenge the graph was made interactive.  By clicking on the user's choice of criteria offered via the X axis titles the chart data points and X axis scales are redrawn to reflect the choice.  Accomplshed.

Coding notes:  My code was based on D3 lesson 12 example. In importing the data, I converted all data from string to intergers regardless whether I was to use them on the graph or not.  This made it easy for me to experiment with the data to see if I could find some especially interesting story to tell.  In the end, I didn't discover any especially interesting relationship with the data and just settled on obesity, smoking, and age.  The point is to show how D3 worked with the graph even if the subject did not provide anything especialy insightful.
