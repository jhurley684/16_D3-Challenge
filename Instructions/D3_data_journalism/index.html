				<h2>Risk Factors Like Smoking and Obesity Are Not Related To Age </h2>
				<p>Sort of...   </p>
	  
				<p>This multi-billion dollar study provided by the Hurley Institute of Fictionalized Data
				  found that in-fact some people in the 28 - 48 age group smoke and some people in the 28 - 48 
				  year age group are fat but our fancy graph technology reveals that if you compare the two
				  risk criteria, the samples shift based on the smoking/obesity scales but don't tend to move
				  up and down the age scale.
				</p>
				<p>On the whole samples show some people are in horrible condition at any age. You would think
				   people would wise up as they get older.  But they probably figure, "I've already found a wife
				   and I don't have any time to work out anyway. Plus I'm stressed out.  Think I'll go for a smoke."
				</p>
				<p>Not you though. You look great.  Have you been working out?
